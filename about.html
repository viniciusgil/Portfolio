        <h1>Hi, there!</h1>
        <h3>A bit about me:</h3>
        <p>
            My name is Vinicius, and I am a driven game developer with a unique background in the hospitality industry.
            After honing my skills for over 8 years as a chef, I embarked on a transformative journey to pursue my passion for game development.
            Equipped with a solid foundation from a comprehensive game development boot camp,
            I am now actively seeking opportunities to contribute my talents as a game developer.
        </p>

        <p>
            In transitioning from the culinary world to game development, I bring a blend of resilience, dedication,
            and professionalism cultivated through the rigours of the hospitality sector. As a seasoned communicator
            with a keen eye for detail, I understand the importance of seamless collaboration and precision in crafting
            immersive gaming experiences. Furthermore, my background as a professional football player has endowed me
            with invaluable leadership skills, forged through years of dedication and perseverance on the field.
        </p>

        <p>
            From the age of 8, I embarked on a journey of discipline and commitment, dedicating myself to rigorous training
            sessions three times a week. By the age of 10, I was getting three buses to attend the training practice,
            showcasing my unwavering determination. At 14, I made the bold decision to leave my parent's home to pursue
            my dream of being a professional football player, and I became professional at the age of 18. Throughout my
            athletic career, I consistently earned the honour of team captain, a testament to my innate leadership qualities
            and ability to inspire and motivate others.
        </p>

        <p>
            Confident in my abilities and fueled by a passion for innovation, I am poised to thrive in the dynamic landscape of the
            game industry. I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to contribute my skills, experience, and unwavering dedication to the
            advancement of interactive entertainment.
